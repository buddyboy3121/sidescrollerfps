Side-Scroller FPS
===============
We did not come up with a good name yet, but it is going to be a 2D shooter-game.
You will be able to build your own base, and then fight online or generated levels.

Ideas
================
- In-game currency                                                      
- Events                                                                
- Can buy reskins and guns with in-game currency or real currency.                  
- Competitions (can win new characters, special guns and skins, etc).            
- Grinding game (must play hours to get enough ingame currency for a gun).
